The `data-connectors` bucket contains diverse generic data connectors for the most frequently used data storage systems (File, SQL, NoSQL, Cloud, ERP). The aim of a data connector is to facilitate and simplify importing data from external sources into your workflows.

=== File
The File connectors allow to import and export data from HTTP, FTP and SFTP servers.
We begin by presenting FTP and SFTP connectors then, URL connector.

==== FTP and SFTP connectors

*Variables:*
The FTP and SFTP connectors share the same list of variables. Consequently, we describe them in the following table using a unique notation.
`<PROTOCOL>` can take one of the following values: {`FTP`, `SFTP`}

.FTP/SFTP Connector variables

The imported data is exported in a JSON format using the variable `DATAFRAME_JSON`.

=== Cloud

Cloud data connectors allow to interact with cloud storage services. Currently we provide support for Amazon S3, Azure Storage and Azure Data Lake.

==== Azure Data Lake

The Azure Data Lake connector allows to upload U-SQL scripts and then execute them as Data Lake Analytics (DLA) jobs. It requires an existing Data Lake Analytics account and its corresponding Data Lake Store account. The connector workflow consists of three tasks:

* _Submit_job_: Connects to Azure Data Lake and submits the provided script.
* _Wait_for_job_: Periodically monitors the DLA job status until its finalization.
* _Display_result_: Downloads the result file and displays it.

*Variables:*

.Azure Data Lake Connector variables
[cols="2,5,2,2,2,2"]
|===
| *Variable name* | *Description* | *Level* | *Required?* | *Type*  | *Default/Examples*
| `AZ_DLA_ACCOUNT`
| Data Lake *Analytics* account to be used. It should already exist.
| Workflow
| Yes
| String
| e.g. my_dla_account
| `AZ_DLS_ACCOUNT`
| Data Lake *Store* account to be used.  It should already exist.
| Workflow
| Yes
| String
| e.g. my_dls_account
| `AZ_DLA_JOB`
| Name to identify the job to be submitted.
| Workflow
| Yes
| String
| e.g. my_dla_job
| `AZ_DLA_SCRIPT`
| File name of the U-SQL script to submit. The file must be located in the *Global Space* directory. An example file `script.usql` is provided.
| Workflow
| Yes
| String
v|Sample file: script.usql
e.g. my_usql_script.usql
| `AZ_DLA_OUTPUT`
| Name of the output file to store the result of the script.
| Workflow
| Yes
| String
| e.g. my_output_file.csv
| `AZ_CRON_MONITOR`
| Cron expression to determine how frequently to monitor the completion of the job.
| Workflow
| Yes
| String
v|Default: "* * * * \*"
(every minute)
e.g. "*/2 * * * *"
(every 2 minutes)
|===

*How to use these tasks:*

Azure Data Lake tasks require your Azure login credentials to be set as third-party credentials (`key:value` pairs); this is a one-time action and will ensure that your credentials are securely encrypted. Please refer to the User documentation to learn how to add link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_third_party_credentials[third-party credentials].

You have two options for providing your login credentials:

* Standard Azure login: `AZ_U:your_user` (usually an email). `AZ_P:your_password`.
* Using an link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?toc=%2Fazure%2Fazure-resource-manager%2Ftoc.json&view=azure-cli-latest[Azure service principal]: `AZ_U:appId`. `AZ_P:password`. `AZ_T:tenant`. By default, if `AZ_T` is set, the tasks will attempt to connect through a service principal.

[NOTE]
====
.The Output File
* Instead of hardcoding the name of your output file in your U-SQL script, you can use the placeholder `OUTPUT_FILE`, which is automatically replaced by the value of `AZ_DLA_OUTPUT`.
* Once downloaded, the output file will be stored in your *User Space* (and _not_ in the Global Space).

=== ERP

Proactive's ERP connectors enable communication and data exchange with popular ERP software providers.

==== SAP ECC

This connector allows you to interact with an SAP ECC system (not S/4HANA) by means of remote function calls (RFC).

*Variables:*

.SAP ECC Connector variables
[cols="2,5,2,2,2,2"]
|===
| *Variable name* | *Description* | *Level* | *Required?* | *Type*  | *Default/Examples*
| `JCO_ FUNCTION`
| the name of a remote-enabled function module on your SAP System. You can verify the available functions in your ECC transaction SE37.
| Workflow
| Yes
| String
| e.g. RFC_SYSTEM_INFO
|===

*How to use this connector:*

In order to securely connect to your SAP ECC system, you first need to store your SAP logon information as ProActive's link:../user/ProActiveUserGuide.html#_third_party_credentials[third-party credentials]. The required credentials are:

.SAP connection credentials
[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| *Credential* | *Description* | *Example*
| `JCO_ASHOST`
| Application server host IP.
| 10.10.10.1
| `JCO_SYSNR`
| System number.
| 00
| `JCO_CLIENT`
| Client number.
| 100
| `JCO_USER`
| SAP logon user name.
| myuser
| `JCO_PASSWD`
| SAP logon password (it will be hidden).
| mypassword
| `JCO_LANG`
| Preferred language.
| EN
| `JCO_SAPROUTER`
| _(Optional)_ An SAP Router string, in case you are connecting from an external
               network. It is important that you keep the /H/ tags.
| /H/192.168.0.1/H/
|===

Once the credentials are set, the workflow can be executed. If the connection is successful, the connection attributes will be listed as output. *NB.* Proactive's SAP connector provides libraries to connect to an SAP server from a 64-bit OS (Windows, Linux, MacOS); libraries for other OS can be obtained through SAP Marketplace.

.Querying for a function
The SAP connector will search for the function module provided as the `JCO_FUNCTION` variable. If the function module exists and is remote-enable, the script will display the function's parameters (import, export, tables) right after the Connection attributes.

.Executing a function
The SAP connector includes an example of how to execute and handle the result of a function using the default `RFC_SYSTEM_INFO`, which returns a structure containing the System's information. After the function is executed, the result can be accessed through the method `getExportParameterList()`.

[source,groovy]
----
// execute RFC_SYSTEM_INFO function
sapFunction.execute(destination)
// obtain structure RFCSI_EXPORT
JCoStructure structure = sapFunction.getExportParameterList().getStructure("RFCSI_EXPORT")
if (structure != null) {
  println("System info:")
  // loop on structure to get the info
  for(JCoField field : structure) {
    println(field.getName() + " : " + field.getString())
  }
}
----

Further information and examples using the SAP JCO library are available in the link:https://help.hana.ondemand.com/javadoc/index.html[SAP Cloud Platform SDK
Documentation] and the SAP Java Connector documentation accessible through link:https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/[SAP Service Marketplace].
